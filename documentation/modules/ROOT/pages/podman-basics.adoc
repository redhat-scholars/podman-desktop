= Podman Desktop Interface & Essentials
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Let's take a look at Podman Desktop and dive into some of the features, tips & tricks, and essentials. We'll start from the top of the UI and work our way down, and don't worry, there's no exercises until the next section.

TIP: Feel free to check out the https://podman-desktop.io[Podman Desktop website and documentation] after this workshop as a reference.

== Dashboard

The Dashboard section is the entry point to your container workflow, where you can easily view and manage the https://podman.io[Podman engine], which is automatically started and updated via Podman Desktop.

In addition, you can view the status of other featured extensions, such as https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview[OpenShift Local], https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker], https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind], https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube], https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox], and https://lima-vm.io/[Lima]. Each of these extensions can be crucial to the development of your applications and workflow.

NOTE: Because of the workshop environment, not all of these extensions may be available, but feel free to try them on your own machine afterwards!

== Containers

The Containers section is where you can view, manage, and create containers. You can easily start, stop, and remove containers, as well as view logs and inspect the container details.

After selecting a running container, you have a few tabs to view container logs, inspect details of the container (such as the environment variables, labels, and mounts), view the Kubernetes YAML to deploy it to a cluster, and an integrated terminal to SSH into the container.

In addition, you can play Kubernetes YAML directly from this top-right corner of the Containers section, and start Pods or Containers directly from Kubernetes YAML via the Podman engine or a connected Kubernetes cluster (we'll cover this in a later section).

== Pods

After creating a Pod through Podman Desktop (selecting one or more containers in the Containers tab, and selecting _Create Pod_), or via the Podman CLI, you can view and manage Pods in the Pods section.

After selecting a Pod, we can view the individual containers that make up the Pod, their logs (or combined logs), and inspect the Pod details, such as the Kubernetes YAML.

Similarly to the Containers section, you can play Kubernetes YAML directly from this top-right corner of the Pods section, or within a Pod, and view details before deploying it to a cluster.

== Images

The Podman Desktop images section is powerful, and allows you to pull images from registries (publicly available, or authenticated from a private registry via Settings), or build images from a Containerfile.

NOTE: `Containerfile` is the vendor-agnostic way to refer to the commonly known `Dockerfile`. You can use them interchangeably with Podman, and in fact you'll see both naming conventions pop up throughout this tutorial.

While pulling images is fairly standard, you can select target platform architectures when building images, in addition to selecting the Containerfile, and the build context directory.

== Kubernetes

Fairly new to Podman Desktop is the Kubernetes section, which provides a more advanced UI for working with Kubernetes clusters. We won't be taking a look at it in this workshop, but there are several other sessions and lightning talks about it at Summit!

TIP: On older versions of Podman Desktop, you may need to enable the experimental Kubernetes UI in *Settings > Kubernetes*.

When working with Kubernetes clusters, either locally or remote, you can view details typically found via `kubectl` commands, such as the Deployments, Services, and Ingresses. Did we mention that `kubectl` is included in the Podman Desktop Settings? Let's head there now.

== Settings

The Settings section is where you can configure almost everything about Podman Desktop, such as the Podman Machine (CPU, Memory, etc), Kubernetes (https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube], https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/[`kubectl`] CLI, https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind], https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox]), https://podman-desktop.io/blog/getting-started-with-compose[Compose], and more.

TIP: On Linux, you won't happen to see any settings for the Podman Machine, as containers are Linux! There are also enterprise features, such as proxy configuration and the ability to connect to a private registry.

One of Podman Desktop's biggest feature is the extensibility through the use of (OCI) Extensions. In fact, Podman Desktop even supports Docker Desktop extensions.

Finally, you can edit preferences such as aesthetics, your `kubeconfig` file, terminal settings, and more via the Preferences section.

NOTE: We didn't cover the Volumes section, which is fairly simple with options for creating new Volumes, collecting usage data, etc. More info can be found in the https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/volume.html[Podman documentation].

== Next Steps

Now that we've covered the essentials of Podman Desktop, let's start doing some hands-on exercises!
