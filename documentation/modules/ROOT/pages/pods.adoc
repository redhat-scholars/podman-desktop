= Working with Pods
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In the previous step, we successfully built, ran, and tested a multi-container application using Podman Desktop. As you know, we had to do a workaround to get the IP from the Redis container and then pass that in as an environment variable to the Quarkus container, which wasn't a very sustainable way to do our local container work. On a production environment, workloads with close affinity might actually be deployed in the same localhost network. To accomplish this same behavior, we could create a docker-compose.yml file and run it with podman (You installed docker-compose during the setup of Podman Desktop). Feel free to check out the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory of podify-quarkus-redis project and then run the following command:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd ~/podify-quarkus-redis && podman compose up
----

You'll notice that both containers are started together and you can even test the application in your browser again. 

The downside of using Docker Compose is that you will need expertise in creating docker-compose.yml files, and it's a little bit of a dead-end street, since you cannot take the definitions in the compose files further to a Kubernetes environment. 

What if instead we could create a nice little 'pod' for our containers to live in together and share their resources? As the name of the project already implies, that's of course exactly what Podman can do!

 Podman Desktop streamlines the process of creating a pod from existing containers, offering a seamless transition from development to Kubernetes, where Pods are the most basic deployable units.

== A Bit about Pods

https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/01/15/podman-managing-containers-pods[Pods] are a fundamental concept in container orchestration systems like Kubernetes and OpenShift. They provide an abstraction layer that encapsulates one or more containers, treating them as a single entity.

Pods offer several key advantages over running containers individually, including:

1. *Simplified management and scalability*: Pods allow you to manage related containers as a single entity, simplifying deployment, scaling, and monitoring processes. By grouping containers that need to work together, you can easily scale your application by adding or removing pod replicas. However, pods are designed to be the smallest deployable unit, and you should avoid running unrelated containers within the same pod.

2. *Efficient resource sharing*: Containers within a pod share the same network namespace, enabling them to communicate with each other using `localhost`. This eliminates the need for complex networking configurations and allows for efficient inter-container communication. Additionally, pods can share volumes, ensuring data persistence and enabling containers to access the same data simultaneously.

3. *Enhanced security and isolation*: Pods provide a level of isolation and security by default. Each pod has its own unique IP address and can define its own network policies, limiting access to and from other pods. Moreover, resource limits and security policies can be applied at the pod level, ensuring better control over the containers' runtime environment.

## Creating Pods from Podman Desktop

Podman Desktop's _Podify_ feature takes advantage of these pod benefits by simplifying the process of creating a pod from existing containers. Let's walk through the steps to create a pod from the Quarkus app and Redis containers.

In the *Containers* section of Podman Desktop, select both the `quarkus-app` and `redis` containers using the checkboxes. Now, click on the *Podify* button from the top right corner menu to initiate the pod creation process.

A new window will appear, allowing you to configure basic pod parameters. Provide a meaningful name for the pod, such as `summit-pod`. Once satisfied, click the *Create Pod* button.

TIP: You'll notice that you only have the option to expose the port of the Quarkus container. Due to the pod's internal networking, it's not necessary to expose the Redis port externally for this application, as they can communicate using `localhost`.

Podman Desktop will now stop the existing containers and create a new pod that encapsulates the selected containers. To view the pod's details and manage its lifecycle, navigate to the *Pods* section in the Podman Desktop interface.

Once selected, you can view the individual container logs within the pod, their Kubernetes manifest, view the application's exposed port in the browser, or directly deploy the pod to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster.

== Preparing for Production Deployments

With the pod created using Podman Desktop's "Podify" feature, you're now well-positioned to deploy your application to a production environment. The next step is to explore how to deploy this pod to a local Kubernetes cluster and leverage advanced features of Podman Desktop for containerized application management.

Podman Desktop seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes and OpenShift, allowing you to deploy pods and manage them within a robust container orchestration framework. You can take advantage of features such as automatic scaling, load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing to ensure the reliability and scalability of your application.

By mastering the "Podify" feature and understanding the power of pods, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to build, test, and deploy containerized applications effectively. Embrace the benefits of pod-based deployments and unlock the full potential of Podman Desktop in your development workflow.
