Welcome to the https://www.redhat.com/en/summit[Red Hat Summit] workshop where you'll *learn how to elevate your container development work with Podman Desktop*. We're glad to have you here with us! Today, we'll explore the features and benefits of https://podman-desktop.io[Podman Desktop] for streamlining your container workflows. Build, manage, and even deploy to local/remote Kubernetes environments â€“ all from your desktop.

== What is Podman Desktop?

Podman Desktop is a powerful open-source tool designed to simplify container management on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Key strengths include:

* **Security:**  Rootless design and https://blog.podman.io/2023/12/interaction-between-user-namespaces-and-capabilities/[strong isolation] for safer containerized applications.
* **Emphasis on Pods** for https://podman.io/features[simplified grouping and resource sharing] of containers.
* **Multi-Engine Support:** Manage not only containers with Podman, but https://podman-desktop.io/extend[Docker, OpenShift, and Kind environments as well].
* **Kubernetes Development:** Efficiently target Kubernetes from your local workstation with built-in Kubernetes support, as well as local Kubernetes development with https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind] and https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube] integrations.
* **Docker Compatibility:** Leverage https://podman-desktop.io/blog/5-things-to-know-for-a-docker-user[familiar Docker concepts] and commands for easy transitions.

== Why Use Podman Desktop?

Podman Desktop focuses on the issue of the https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/d2iq.com/resources/report/kubernetes-in-the-enterprise-survey.pdf[complexity between local development and production environments]. It provides a consistent and secure environment for building, managing, and deploying containers, pods, and Kubernetes-like environments. With extensions for https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/[Minikube], https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind], https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview[OpenShift Local], and more, Podman Desktop is a powerful tool for developers and operators alike!
