= Deploying Pods to Kubernetes
include::_attributes.adoc[]

With the new connection to our Developer Sandbox cluster, you can easily deploy pods and containers directly from Podman Desktop to Kubernetes. Podman Desktop provides intuitive options to generate Kubernetes manifests and deploy pods to the cluster.

== Deploying a Pod to Kubernetes

Let's begin by deploying the Quarkus & Redis container pod to the Developer Sandbox. In the *Pods* section of Podman Desktop, select the `summit-pod` you created earlier. Click on the *Deploy to Kubernetes* button from the top right corner menu.

Podman Desktop will generate the necessary Kubernetes manifests for the pod and its associated resources. Review the generated manifests and make any necessary adjustments, which for us will include *Creating OpenShift routes* to access our exposted ports. Now, hit the *Deploy* button to deploy the pod to the selected Kubernetes cluster.

TIP: You can specify the Kubernetes context where you want to deploy the pod by selecting the desired context from the dropdown menu in the bottom left corner.

Podman Desktop will communicate with the Kubernetes API server and create the required resources in the cluster. You can monitor the deployment status, and when ready, access the deployed application using the provided URL.

=== Accessing the Deployed Application

Once the pod is successfully deployed to Kubernetes, you can access the Quarkus application's endpoint directly from Podman Desktop by clicking on the `summit-pod-8080` link.

You should see the familiar Quarkus application with the Redis-backed counter, now running on the Developer Sandbox.

=== Managing the Deployment

Kubernetes allows you to easily modify and manage your deployments. Back in Podman Desktop, select *Open in OpenShift console* from the right hand side to access the OpenShift console for the deployed pod.

Now in the OpenShift console, you can view the details of the deployed pod, including its status, events, and logs.

TIP: In the *Topology* view, you can also scale the deployment by adjusting the number of replicas and manage the pod's lifecycle.

Additionally, Podman Desktop provides insights into the resource utilization and performance of your pods. You can view metrics such as CPU, filesystem, and memory usage.

== Updating and Rolling Back Deployments

Kubernetes enables you to perform rolling updates and rollbacks of your deployments. Podman Desktop simplifies these operations, allowing you to update your application with minimal downtime.

To update the Flask + Redis deployment:

1. Make the necessary changes to your application code or configuration.
2. Rebuild the container image with the updated code using Podman Desktop.
3. In the *Kubernetes* section of Podman Desktop, navigate to the namespace where your deployment is running.
4. Click on the deployment to view its details.
5. In the deployment details page, click on the *Update* button and select the updated container image.

Podman Desktop will initiate a rolling update of the deployment, gradually replacing the old pods with new ones running the updated container image. You can monitor the progress of the update and ensure that the application remains available during the process.

If necessary, you can also perform a rollback to a previous version of the deployment. Podman Desktop allows you to select a previous revision and restore the deployment to that state.

== Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a Quarkus + Redis application to Kubernetes using Podman Desktop. You have learned how to generate Kubernetes manifests, deploy pods, and manage your application in the Developer Sandbox.
