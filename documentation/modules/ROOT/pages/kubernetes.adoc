= Kubernetes & Podman Desktop
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard for container orchestration, providing a robust and scalable platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. Podman Desktop seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, enabling developers to leverage the power of Kubernetes while benefiting from the user-friendly interface and features of Podman Desktop.

== Understanding Kubernetes

https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes[Kubernetes] is an open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a declarative approach to defining and managing application components, ensuring high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Key concepts in Kubernetes include:

1. *Pods*: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

2. *Services*: An abstraction layer that provides a stable network endpoint for accessing pods, enabling load balancing and service discovery.

3. *Deployments*: A higher-level abstraction that manages the deployment and scaling of pods, ensuring the desired state of the application is maintained.

4. *ConfigMaps and Secrets*: Objects used to store configuration data and sensitive information, respectively, which can be injected into pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

Kubernetes follows a declarative model, where users define the desired state of their application using YAML or JSON manifests. The Kubernetes control plane, consisting of components like the API server, scheduler, and controller manager, continuously works to ensure the actual state matches the desired state.

=== Running Kubernetes Objects with Podman Desktop

While Kubernetes provides a powerful platform for container orchestration, it can be complex to set up and manage, especially for developers new to Kubernetes. For those looking to work and interact with Kubernetes objects, Podman Desktop allows you to directly run and manage objects such as Pods and Deployments, directly from the *Pods* section of the interface. Select *Play Kubernetes YAML* to get started.

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-objects.png[Podman Desktop Kubernetes Objects, 600]

Here, we'll need to select a Kubernetes YAML file to run. For example, let's run a simple `nginx-deployment.yaml` It creates a ReplicaSet to bring up three nginx Pods. 

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
----

Back in Podman Desktop, first, select *Browse*.

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-play-yaml.png[Podman Desktop Play Kubernetes YAML, 600]

From the *Home* directory, navigate to `podman-desktop-demo/pods/nginx-deployment.yaml` and click *Select* or double click. 

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-select-yaml.png[Podman Desktop Select Kubernetes YAML, 600]

Now, you can hit *Play* from Podman Desktop to create the necessary resources within the Podman engine.

== Integrating Kubernetes with Podman Desktop

As mentioned, Podman Desktop provides a seamless integration with Kubernetes, starting from the setup of a local Kubernetes cluster to deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes. Let's take a look at how easy it is to spin up, and connect, to a Kubernetes cluster using Podman Desktop.

=== Provisioning a Kubernetes Cluster

NOTE: During this workshop, we'll be directly connecting to a remote Kubernetes cluster. This information is just as a reference for later use.

Podman Desktop includes extensions to manage local Kubernetes clusters, enabling developers to deploy and test their applications in a Kubernetes environment without the need for external setup. The local cluster is powered by https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)] or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/[Minikube], providing a lightweight and isolated Kubernetes environment. To start a local KinD cluster in Podman Desktop:

Navigate to the *Settings* section in Podman Desktop and select *Create new Kind cluster*.

image::podman-desktop-settings-kind.png[Podman Desktop Settings, 600]

You'll view Kind cluster settings here such as a name, port assignment (for forwarding your applications), and Kubernetes version. Choose the desired container engine provider (Podman or Docker) and click the *Create* button.

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-settings.png[Podman Desktop Kubernetes Settings, 600]

Podman Desktop will spin up the local Kubernetes cluster, and you can verify your connection from the *Pods* section of the interface, or at the bottom-left of the screen, where you can switch between different Kubernetes contexts.

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-cluster.png[Podman Desktop Kubernetes Cluster, 600]

You can also follow a similar path in order to provision and connect to a Minikube cluster. In order to work with your local container images, simply load them into the cluster using through the kebab menu in the *Images* section.

=== Connecting to a Remote Kubernetes Cluster

While working with a local Kubernetes instance is one way to tackle the inner loop of your development cycle, it's also quite common to work with remote dev/test clusters. Let's take a look at how we can connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster. In this workshop, we'll be using the https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[*Developer Sandbox*] extension, which allows us to provision and connect to a remote Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, with 14GB of RAM and 40GB of storage. To get started, let's install it from the *Dashboard*, or from the *Settings -> Extensions* section in Podman Desktop.

image::podman-desktop-extensions-devsandbox.png[Podman Desktop Extensions, 600]

Once installed, you can provision a new cluster from the *Developer Sandbox* section in the *Settings -> Resources*. 

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-provision.png[Podman Desktop Provision Developer Sandbox, 600]

You'll firstly prompted to log into the Developer Sandbox with your Red Hat account. Once logged in, you can access the free Red Hat OpenShift cluster when you'll recieve the authentication token.

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-login.png[Podman Desktop Login Developer Sandbox, 600]

From the OpenShift Web Console, click the top-right user icon and select *Copy Login Command*.

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-login-command-copy.png[Podman Desktop Copy Login Command, 600]

After this, you'll need to also select *Display Token* and copy the token.

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-login-token-copied.png[Podman Desktop Copy Login Token, 600]

Back in Podman Desktop, paste the copied command into the *Developer Sandbox* section and click *Create*.

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-login-command-pasted.png[Podman Desktop Paste Login Command, 600]

Fantastic! You are now connected to a remote Developer Sandbox Kubernetes cluster. You can verify your connection from the *Resources* section of the interface.

image::podman-desktop-devsandbox-cluster.png[Podman Desktop Developer Sandbox Cluster, 600]

=== Managing Kubernetes Resources

NOTE: You may have to restart Podman Desktop after logging in to the Developer Sandbox before you can see the Kubernetes context and resources.

Podman Desktop provides a centralized interface for managing Kubernetes resources, including pods, services, deployments, and more. You can view and interact with Kubernetes objects directly from the Podman Desktop interface, although it's only visible once you have a connection to a Kubernetes cluster.

The *Kubernetes* interface in Podman Desktop displays an overview of the cluster, including the number of nodes, pods, and services. You can drill down into specific namespaces and view the details of individual resources.

image::podman-desktop-kubernetes-overview-dashboard.png[Podman Desktop Kubernetes Overview, 600]

Podman Desktop integrates with the Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`), allowing you to directly modify applied YAML and perform advanced operations directly from the terminal within the Podman Desktop interface.

== Next Steps

In this section, we've explored the integration of Kubernetes with Podman Desktop, including provisioning a local or remote Kubernetes cluster and managing Kubernetes resources. In the next section, we'll deploy our existing Pod to the Developer Sandbox cluster to share with the world!
